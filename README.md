# GradingSystem

Requirements

Objecive:
The purpose of this assignment is to develop a comprehensive Student Grading System that
progresses through three stages of implementa8on. The goal is to assess students' understanding
and proficiency in various technologies, frameworks, and concepts related to backend
development, web applica8on development, and Spring MVC/Spring REST.

Part 1: Command-line / Sockets and JDBC Backend Implementa&on

Task:
Build the ini8al version of the Student Grading System using the command-line interface,
sockets, and JDBC in the backend.

Requirements:
• Design a MySQL database schema to store student informa8on, courses, and grades.
• Create a command-line interface that allows students to log in and access their marks in
different courses.
• U8lize JDBC to interact with the MySQL database, retrieve student data, and manage
grades.
• Implement socket communica8on for any real-8me requirements.



Part 2: Web App / Tradi&onal MVC Servlets and JSPs Implementa&on

Task:
Enhance the Student Grading System by transforming it into a web applica8on using tradi8onal
MVC Servlets and JSPs.

Requirements:
• Develop HTML and JSP files for user login, mark visualiza8on, and display of sta8s8cal data
(e.g., class average, median, highest, and lowest marks).
• Create servlets to handle user requests, manage sessions, and interact with the database
using JDBC.
• Ensure secure user login func8onality and access to their respec8ve marks.


Part 3: Web App / Spring MVC and Spring REST Implementa&on

Task:
Advance the Student Grading System by migra8ng it to a web applica8on u8lizing Spring MVC
and Spring REST.

Requirements:
• Configure Spring for the applica8on and integrate Spring MVC and Spring REST modules.
• Replace tradi8onal Servlets with Spring controllers to handle user requests and responses.
• Implement Spring Security for secure user authen8ca8on and authoriza8on.
• Employ Spring JDBC template or JPA for database interac8on.
